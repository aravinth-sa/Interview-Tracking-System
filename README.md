## Interview Tracking System ##
This repository contains the codebase for the Interview Tracking System, a project developed during my Wipro training internship. Built with Java Spring, this application streamlines the interview process from initial record creation to the final HR stages.

Project Overview
The Interview Tracking System is designed to empower interviewers with a centralized platform to manage the entire hiring interview lifecycle. It allows for the creation of new interview records, assignment of specific interviewees, and comprehensive management of all subsequent operations leading up to the human resources process. This system aims to enhance efficiency and organization in the recruitment workflow.

Key Features
Interview Record Creation: Interviewers can easily create new interview records, capturing essential details.

Interviewee Assignment: Seamlessly assign specific candidates to scheduled interviews.

Comprehensive Interview Management: Manage all stages of the interview process, including:

Updating interview statuses.

Recording feedback and notes.

Tracking candidate progress.

HR Process Integration: Supports operations relevant to the transition into the HR phase, ensuring a smooth handover.

Technologies Used
Backend: Java, Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA)

What This Project Demonstrates
This internship project showcases my practical skills in:

Backend Development: Building robust and scalable applications using the Java Spring Framework.

Database Interaction: Managing data persistence and retrieval with Spring Data JPA.

System Design: Designing an application that supports a clear workflow and user roles.

Problem-Solving: Addressing real-world challenges in recruitment process management.

This project was a valuable experience in applying theoretical knowledge to a practical business solution within an enterprise environment.
